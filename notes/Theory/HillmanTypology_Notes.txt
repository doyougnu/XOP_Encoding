Context
=======

  This document is for the XOP Encoding project, participants include
  Eric Walkingshaw and Jeffrey Young. This is the third such primer in
  the project, the first one is a primer on DN-Theory, the second a
  primer on typologies of explanation, specifically Bellack et al's
  typology. This document expands on bellack et al's typology by
  summarizing the thesis of Dan Hillman. Dan Hillman iterated on
  bellack's typology, changing and improving it in several ways, and
  hence his typology is of interest to the XOP project. Dan Hillman was
  also kind enough to provide the data he compiled with his typology for
  the XOP Project.


Orientation
===========

  This document is meant to explicate three things:
  1. What are Hillman's changes to Bellack's typology and why
  2. What is the nature of the data that Hillman compiled and it is
     useful to the XOP project?
  3. What did Hillman learn from his data, what were the conclusions of
     his thesis?

\section*{Purpose}
\label{sec:org4c99545}
The Purpose of encodings is to systematically and formally codify real world, in the wild, explanations so that observing larger patterns becomes possible. The end goal of this is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate a database of encodings
\item Analyze database to find patterns of explanation
\item 1 and 2 become formative work for exploring DSL possibilities in XOP
\end{enumerate}
\section*{Scope}
\label{sec:orgd9f9156}
The scope of the database is restricted to explanations of common Computer Science algorithms \uline{from} Universities only. Restricting the scope in this manner provides two benefits:
\begin{enumerate}
\item All explanatory objects have a stated, intrinsic goal to communicate the mechanics, application, and implementation of similar things
\item There are numerous examples of different approaches to explain \uline{the same} thing, and numerous examples of \uline{like} approaches to explain different things
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Some Terminology}
\label{sec:org8a62c5b}
In our terminology an explanation is called an "explanation artifact", our
  working model of the process of explaining is a non-linear sequence of
  "steps", where each "step" denotes some progress in the understanding of the
  explanation artifact on the part of the information receiver. More formally:
\begin{description}
\item[{Explanatory Artifact}] The whole explanation, including all the step taken in the explanation, the language used in the explanation etc.
\item[{Step}] The steps that are taken, in an explanatory artifact, that guide the
reader from non-understanding to understanding.
\end{description}
\section*{Syntax}
\label{sec:org74ac92a}
The syntax of an encoding is given by \_ - \_ - \_ - \_ \(\subseteq\) Location \texttimes{} Level \texttimes{} Role \texttimes{} Notation where \\

l \(\in\) \(\mathbb{N}\) \\

g \(\in\) Level ::= Problem | Algorithm | Implementation \\

r \(\in\) Role ::= Background | Definition | Constraint | Example | Application | Variant | Analogy | Idea | Proof | Performance | Properties \\

n \(\in\) Notation ::= English | Math | Diagram | List | Table | Sequence | Pseudocode | Code | Animation | Picture | Plot | Empty | n/n \\

\section*{Semantics}
\label{sec:org96cc204}
\subsection*{Location}
\label{sec:org0f2d149}
a location \(l\), specifies the location that the encoding is referring to,
this could be a slide, a number line etc.
\subsection*{Level}
\label{sec:org0b85806}
a Level \(g\), Specifies the level of abstraction for a given step, a level can by one of:
\begin{description}
\item[{Problem}] \(\triangleq\) the purpose of a given step is to elucidate the
motivating problem of the algorithm, i.e the problem that the algorithm
will solve
\item[{Algorithm}] \(\triangleq\) the purpose of a given step is to explain the
algorithm at hand
\item[{Implementation}] \(\triangleq\) the purpose of a given step is to explain the
implementation details of the algorithm, e.g. What data structures to
use, What the form of the code that implements the algorithm should be
\end{description}

\subsection*{Role}
\label{sec:orgb8ef15e}
a Role \(r\), specifies how the Level is trying to be reached, denotes the
answer to question such as "What is the step trying to convey?":

In general the meaning of each role is:
\begin{description}
\item[{Definition}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that explicitly provides a
formal definition.
\item[{Example}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that provides an Example
\item[{Application}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that explains what the
algorithm is useful for
\item[{Background}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that describes the history,
creators, genealogy of the Algorithm
\item[{Variant}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that describes things that are
similar but slightly different than the algorithm. For example, describing
Prim's algorithm and it's similarities to Dijkstra's or describing the
similarities between a dog and a wolf
\item[{Analogy}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that provides an Analogy to
explain the algorithm at hand. For example a visual analogy for Dijkstra's
could be: If you have a physical model of a graph, and you pick it up by
one vertex, then the vertex with the shortest path to the "source" vertex
will be the one farthest from the ground.
\item[{Performance}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that explicitly describes
the computational complexity of the level
\item[{Idea}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that adds an abstract idea to the
explanation as a way to progress. For example, the statement "Well we have
this, \uline{what if we did} this?"
\item[{Constraint}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a step that explicitly presents a
limit or condition in which the level would cease to be valid, e.g.
Dijkstra's only works on non-negative weighted graphs
\item[{Proof}] \(\triangleq\) A given level is reached by a formal proof
\end{description}

Consider the following matrix of Level Role combinations of Dijkstra's
algorithm. Not all of the cells will be orthogonal to each other. In this case
we would have: \\

\textbf{Problem}: How to traverse the shortest path in a non-negative
weighted graph \\

\textbf{Algorithm}: Dijkstra's Algorithm \\

\textbf{Implementation}: You should use a Priority Queue that has
efficient lookup, mutate operations. \\

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\bot\) used to denote cells which may be nonsensical \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notation}
\label{sec:orgb869863}
a Notation \(n\), specifies the form of the role, and can be one of:
\begin{description}
\item[{English}] \(\triangleq\) Human language to give explanations/statements.
\item[{Diagram}] \(\triangleq\) Diagram in the manner of data structures, such as graph, list.
\item[{List}] \(\triangleq\) List of similar items
\item[{OrderedList}] \(\triangleq\) Step by step items
\item[{Math}] \(\triangleq\) Formulas/math style symbols.
\item[{Pseudocode}] \(\triangleq\) Algorithm presented as pseudocode
\item[{Code}] \(\triangleq\) executable code to show the algorithm explicitly
\item[{Tables}] \(\triangleq\) Explanatory information displayed in a table
\item[{Animation}] \(\triangleq\) a gif or animation of any type is used.
\item[{Picture}] \(\triangleq\) A photo/screenshot or picture is used.
\end{description}

for example a definition might be described in English, followed by the same
definition described by geometry. Notations can be combined for a single
location like so:
\begin{equation}
   \(\frac{n \in \text{Notation} \quad m \in \text{Notation}}{n/m \in \text{Notation}}\)
\end{equation}

Related;This modifier takes any number of arguments of any type. It denotes that the tags it is attached to are substantially related to the thesis topic in some manner. Ex: The more general shortest-path problem, is related, to the motivating problem for Dijkstra’s algorithm.;Modifiers;
->;Subscoping operator. This means that scopes are nested. For example, if you have a code at position x that reads “Constituent, Description” and then a paragraph/line/s later, at position y, you have “->, Complexity” then you are no denoting teh complexity of the consituent being discussed. This is opposed to having just “Complexity” at position y which would denote the complexity of whatever the previous structuring move was.;Modifiers;
Meta;This modifier takes any number of tags of any type. It denotes text that is not directly related to explaining the scope at hand. Ex: This algorithm is hard for many people to understand because of its simplicity.;Modifiers;

Review;This modifier takes any number of tags of any type. It denotes that the purpose of those tags is to provide a pedagogical review of the material to the reader.;Modifiers;
<-;Subscoping lifting operator. This operator ends subscoping context, returning the scope to whatever the prior scope was. For example if you had “Operation” then a few lines down you have “->” “Complexity” then the scope would be talking about Operation Complexity. If after a few more lines you had “<-“ “Observation” Then you are now making a general observation about the Operation, not the Operation complexity. This is in contrast to just “Observation” which, in this case, would then be making an Observation of the Operation Complexity;Modifiers;

This tag is often used with the “Related” modifier to denote the discussion of a related problem that is similar to the Thesis Topic but is not the thesis topic. Ex: Considering, discussing and explaining the shortest-path problem in relation to the motivating problem for dijkstra’s algorithm.;Modifiers;

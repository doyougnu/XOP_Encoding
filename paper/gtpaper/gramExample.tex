  2.2 Mergesort :Algorithm
  
  The algorithms that we consider in this section is based on a simple operation
  known as merging: combining two ordered arrays to make one larger ordered
  array. :Description In Vivo
  This operation immediately lends itself to a simple recursive sort
  method known as mergesort: to sort an array, divide it into two halves, sort
  the two halves (recursively), and then merge the results. : Description

  \text{<sample picture here} : Cartoon

  Mergesort guarantees to sort an array of N items in time proportional to N log
  N, no matter what the input. :-> Motivation Description

  Its prime disadvantage is that it uses extra space proportional to N. : |
  Disadvantage Description

  Abstract in-place merge. : | Operation

    1 & 2.2 Mergesort & Algorithm \\
    \\

    2 & The algorithms that we consider in this section is based on a simple operation
    known as merging: combining two ordered arrays to make one larger ordered
    array. & Description In Vivo\\
    \\

    3 & This operation immediately lends itself to a simple recursive sort
    method known as mergesort: to sort an array, divide it into two halves, sort
    the two halves (recursively), and then merge the results. & Description \\

    5 & Mergesort guarantees to sort an array of N items in time proportional to N log
    N, no matter what the input. & -> Motivation Description \\
    \\

    6 & Its prime disadvantage is that it uses extra space proportional to N. & |

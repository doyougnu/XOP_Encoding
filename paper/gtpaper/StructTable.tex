   \textbf{Structure} &  Structure tags control how the context in the artifact is set \\
    \hline
    $\rightarrow$ & Push: takes one content tag and sets the context to the conjunction of the input tag and parent context \\
    $\leftarrow$ & Pop: takes any number of action or expression tags as input, sets context up one level, and then applies input tags\\
    \text{|} & Takes one content tag as input, synonymous with the sequence $\leftarrow$, $\rightarrow$ \brackets{input tag} \\
    $\twoheadleftarrow$ & Return: takes no input, pops until top level is reached

      return and pipe!} \\

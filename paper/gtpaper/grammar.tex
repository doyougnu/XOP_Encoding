    Structure &  Structure tags control how the context in the artifact is set \\
    \hline
    $\rightarrow$ & Push: takes one content tag and sets the context to the conjunction of the input tag and parent context \\
    $\leftarrow$ & Pop: takes any number of action or expression tags as input, sets context up one level, and then applies input tags.\\
    $|$ & Swap: takes one content tag as input, synonymous with the sequence $\leftarrow, \rightarrow \text{<input tag>}$ \\
    $\twoheadleftarrow$ & return: takes no input, pops until top level is reached \\
\\
    Content & Content tags denote \emph{what} is being discussed in a snippet of text \\
